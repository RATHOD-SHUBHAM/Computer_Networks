# Computer Network.

## WireShark:
    - One's understanding of network protocols can often be greatly deepened by "seeing protocols in action" and by "playing around with protocols" - observing thw sequence of messages exchanges between two protocol entities, delving down into the details of protocol operation, and causing protocols to perform certain actions and then observing these actions and their consequences. This can be done in simulated scenarios or in a "real" network environment such as the Internet.

    - Wireshark is a shareware packet sniffer. The basic tool for observing the messages exchanged between executing protocol entities is called a packet sniffer. As the name suggests, a packet sniffer passively copies ("sniffs") messages being sent from and received by your computer; it will also display the contents of the various protocol fields of these captured messages.

    - These Lab helped me deepen my knowledge about working of the protocols. My reading from the lab are available above.
